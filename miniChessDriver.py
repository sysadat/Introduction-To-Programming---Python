## Here's the crude, unpolished first version of a user
## interface for your miniChess function

## It doesn't really know much about who wins the game
## or when...although it does know that if it can't make
## a move, the human player wins.

## It does not validate the coordinates for the move
## that is entered by the user.  You can move any pawn
## on either side to any square.  So be careful.

## your definitions for move_maker and
## move_chooser go up here in this space




## below is what we supply ======================================


## print a board
## 0 prints as '-', 1 prints as 'w', 2 prints as 'b'

def printBoard(board):
    print("   ", end = "")
    for i in range(0, len(board[0])):
        print(str(i)+" ", end = "")

    print("\n")
    row = 0
    for r in board:
        print(row, " ", end = "")
        for c in r:
            if c == 1:
                print("w ", end = "")
            elif c == 2:
                print("b ", end = "")
            else:
                print("- ", end = "")
        print()
        row = row + 1
    print()
            

## create an initial board, with dimension
## passed as the argument. 1s at the top,
## 2s at the bottom, 0s everywhere else
    
def makeInitBoard(dim):
    board = []
    for i in range(0,dim):
        row = []
        for j in range(0,dim):
            row.append(0)
        board.append(row)

    for i in range(0,dim):
        board[0][i] = 1
        board[dim - 1][i] = 2

## interaction window
